"""Classification: model-ready tensor -> structured findings.

Wraps the TorchXRayVision DenseNet behind a pluggable interface (D-11) and turns
its raw output into a structured, per-finding result: probability + present/absent
flag decided by the model's *published* operating points (D-07), never
hand-tuned.

Activation exposure (Phase 3 groundwork): the classifier retains the feature
activations from each forward pass. GradCAM (Phase 3) must hook the same
convolutional features that produced the prediction; exposing them here means
Phase 3 does not have to re-run inference. See DECISIONS.md (Phase 2 note).
